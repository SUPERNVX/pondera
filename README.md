   - Supports multiple input formats (0-10, 0-100, A-F, concepts)

2. **GPA Point Assignment**
   - 9.0-10.0 → 4.0 (A)
   - 8.0-8.9 → 3.0 (B)
   - 7.0-7.9 → 2.0 (C)
   - 6.0-6.9 → 1.0 (D)
   - <6.0 → 0.0 (F)

3. **Weighted Calculations**
   - **Honors Level:** +0.5 bonus points
   - **AP Level:** +1.0 bonus points
   - **Core vs Elective:** Separate calculations for core subjects

4. **Credit System**
   - Standard credit assignment per subject
   - Weighted average calculation considering credit hours
   - Annual and cumulative GPA computation
